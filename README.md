# Simple fb messenger bot to gather symptoms for COVID19 disease

Just asks regularly 6 health question and one location and gathered data, being anonimyzed, could be used by scientists and agencies to build better model about COVID19 spread

Project for devpost CGH hackathon


for now FB app for bot is in development stage so you'll probably won't be able to start speaking to it right away. ping me (demosglok@gmail.com) to add you as tested. I'll try to move FBapp for this bot through review ASAP so other can also talk to this bot. 

Find the bot on messenger as Covid19SymptomsBot
